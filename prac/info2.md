i'm fucked now

In recent years, there has been a shift in the terminology used for the default branch in Git and GitHub from "master" to "main." This change was made to move away from terminology that has racist and oppressive connotations.

When creating a new repository on GitHub, the default branch is now called "main" by default. However, if you create a repository locally using Git, the default branch will still be called "master" unless you configure it otherwise.
